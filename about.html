          <p>
           I recieved my Bachelors Degree in Business from Lander University afterwards, I served in the
           Air Force as a Crew Chief. Once I completed my service, I decided to get my Masters in Project Management 
          from The Citadel Graduate College. I worked at a company as an IT Project Manager
          and saw that the developers were having way more fun coding and talking about new
          technology than I was being a Project Manager. I decided it was time for a change. 
          I enrolled in Code Camp CHS and upon completion, I decided that I wanted to get deeper 
          knowledge so I enrolled in JRS Coding School and that was the best career decision I could
          have made.
          <p>In my free time, I like to work out, try new restaurants, go on road trips to new places
           and learn new things. I am trying to learn to cook healthy meals but I really have no clue
           what I am doing in the kitchen but the fun is in the attempts.</p>
